# Strive Transport Registration System
This is the capstone project for my Diploma in Information Technology at UNISA for subject ICT3715.

## Goal of the project
Create a website that allows parents from a specific high school (Strive High) to register their kids for bus transport, edit their details, and apply for space on certain bus routes for their kids. Site admins must be able to register and edit user accounts for the parents, do everything that the parents can do on their accounts, remove parent and learner accounts, and cancel applications for learners.

## Tech Stack
Used vanilla PHP along with vanilla JavaScript, Bootstrap CSS and MySQL. I used XAMPP as my local server.

## Design Methodology
Used the MVC framework

## Test Data
It is stored in the stors_backup SQL file. Create a "stors" database in MySQL and import the contents of stors_backup there.
